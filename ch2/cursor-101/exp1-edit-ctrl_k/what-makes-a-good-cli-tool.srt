1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
gnu parallel dude I've been I've been

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:09,178
telling you to use gnu parallel for how

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,859
long now I swear I I just sit here and I

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,599
look at this and it just makes me want

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,759
to die a little bit on the inside how

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,839
many times do I have to tell you

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,760
just learn your command line tools okay

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,039
gnu parallel is out of this world good

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,720
now here's the deal if you just take a

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,699
moment uh

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,018
if you just take just a small moment and

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,000
learn to write all your programs like

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,460
this all your CLI tools like this is

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
that your CLI tool should operate in one

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,179
of a couple ways first off you should be

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,280
able to take your standard in right as

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,738
input you should also be able to take in

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,079
just any old file as an input right you

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,320
get a file path as an input your output

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,939
should either be the standard out

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
right

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,899
or you should be able to specify as a

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,140
command line property a file to go to

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,939
all right and then lastly all output you

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,159
want to see but you don't want to

26
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,218
interrupt basic program flow you should

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,140
just put two standard error right this

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,579
is just like how you should do this the

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,560
reason why this is so good is when you

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,959
have a program like parallel let's just

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,519
say that you need to go and you can make

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,779
unlimited connections it's not about the

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,739
connections it's just simply about

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,079
getting

35
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,579
you know the the goodness is in right

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,899
you just need to be able to do this so

37
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,879
what you could do is you could have a

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,580
process that goes and gets data right

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,099
you get a bunch of data you get data and

40
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,920
then after that you can take that and

41
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,319
you can just pipe this in to parallel

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,118
and just pass in the script you want to

43
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,978
run and so that every single row of that

44
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,659
data coming back it goes and does that

45
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,938
thing and then you can say like hey I

46
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,759
want to constrain parallel to only 25

47
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,438
running parallel processes you can like

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
constrain it you can do a bunch of stuff

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,819
as long as you follow this little thing

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,618
right here you will never run into

51
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,078
problems with running things super fast

52
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,478
on your own system and like it's so

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,000
important just just learn the thing just

54
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,379
learn just just just learn the thing and

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,759
then here's a little last little tip I

56
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,640
do you see this little call right here

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,500
let's pretend this is an asynchronous uh

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
call it kind of sucks it is what it is

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,000
and so you have to do it so what I

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,159
typically do let's just call it GD is

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,180
I'll do a get data and I'll pipe it into

62
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,859
t

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,620
and then I'll put a little break point

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,780
in here right out right and then I'll do

65
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,000
the next pipe into like parallel

66
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,739
and do the next little thing and so that

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,759
way what I can do is I can have like a

68
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,500
little break point so I don't have to

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,179
refetch the data and if I have several

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,400
stages in my pipe I'll throw a little T

71
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,080
in there so I can get the data at these

72
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,760
little various points you know I mean

73
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,780
because like at one point I had to fetch

74
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,878
like

75
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,318
three or four different pieces of data

76
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,598
from three or four different databases

77
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,039
and there was like hundreds of thousands

78
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,318
of lines I had to go through for

79
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,780
Netflix's gaming stuff and so it's like

80
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,699
I just had to like I kept teeing along

81
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,039
the way because as I got some of the

82
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,479
data I could save that break point and

83
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,159
so just in case like my internet died

84
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,259
which it does the VPN shits the bed

85
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,259
which it does all the time my goodness

86
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,479
what's t t literally takes standard in

87
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,818
saves it to the file and prints it back

88
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,539
out on standard out so it's like a break

89
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:08,458
point right on uh on your on your piping

90
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,859
it's very very good

91
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,479
it's very very good there you go right

92
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,300
better

93
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,399
you know tools honestly just just start

94
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,900
here you've got to start here this is

95
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,819
like my most valuable lesson for the

96
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,980
last couple years is just like focus

97
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,780
more on reading standard in and writing

98
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,158
to standard out and using standard error

99
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,959
more appropriately and then also having

100
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,239
this little file escapes the reason why

101
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,860
I really like file escapes is that let's

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,658
just say that you want to write say an

103
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,819
integration test or an end-to-end test

104
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,799
for your little command line Library if

105
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,079
you have file and standard in as the

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,719
same thing and they can both be read the

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,060
same way you can use the file operator

108
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,919
you can use a file as like your uh test

109
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,500
input and so that way you have a golden

110
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,000
input you can have a golden output and

111
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,400
then you can just compare the two files

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,378
you can literally run the file you know

113
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
run your program with this file out to

114
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:58,919
this file compare the results and it

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,319
makes it super super simple to write

116
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,818
stuff and so I just do that all the time

117
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,979
like that is my way of trying to write

118
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,318
things is always doing that yes I call

119
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,959
it the golden shower test it's my

120
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,339
favorite kind of test I do actually want

121
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,860
to do a front and Master's course on

122
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,719
writing good tools I think that'd be

123
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,400
actually a lot of fun to do and it's

124
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,160
kind of like right up my Alleyway the

125
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,439
golden what it's the Golden Test pick

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,660
what did you think I said what what the

127
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,079
name is I can't believe this became a

128
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,080
YouTube video
